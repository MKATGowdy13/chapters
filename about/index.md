## About us:

Hello! I'm a normal high school student  learning a language that many consider to be dead. It took me hours of studying, lots of painful tests and alot of coffee to learn this language. I wondered why wasn't there a website to help people with Latin. So, as my New Year's Resolution, I decided to make a blog-style website to teach people about one of the most important  languages there is. It's not going to be easy. Trust me, I know. I also enjoy making fun of Latin, and will do it often.
